# RockPaperScissors
A simple game of rock, paper, scissors in python.

I created this game by making two players. One of the players is the user and the other is the computer. I then used If/else statements to finish the outcomes that
would happen depending on what the user picked. Rock, paper, and scissors were randomly generated and picked for the computer player.
